## DeFi Kingdoms Custom Subnet Development

Welcome to DeFi Kingdoms! This readme will guide you through the process of developing custom subnets within the DeFi Kingdoms decentralized finance application. While DeFi Kingdoms is a highly complex platform, we'll focus specifically on custom subnet development in this discussion.

### Getting Started

To begin developing custom subnets for DeFi Kingdoms, follow these steps:

1. **Deploy Your EVM Subnet Using the Avalanche CLI**: Utilize the Avalanche Command Line Interface (CLI) to deploy your custom Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) subnet.

2. **Add Your Subnet to Metamask**: Add your custom subnet to the Metamask wallet to enable interaction with your deployed contracts.

3. **Set Your Subnet as Selected Network in Metamask**: Ensure that your custom subnet is selected as the active network in Metamask for seamless integration.

4. **Connect Remix to Your Metamask**: Connect the Remix IDE to your Metamask wallet using the Injected Provider option.

5. **Deploy the Smart Contracts**: Deploy your custom smart contracts to your EVM subnet using Remix or another suitable development environment.

6. **Test Your Application**: Utilize Remix or other testing frameworks to interact with your deployed smart contracts, deploy tokens, pools, and more, ensuring everything functions as expected.
